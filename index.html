Welcome to my webpage!<br>
I am a research scientist, interested in maths, physics, and computer science.
I focus on real-world applications of the theory of mathematics.
In particular, I like to investigate secure communication and acoustics.

<h2>Cryptography</h2>
I got a PhD from Université de Lorraine and Thales in 2021 (<a href="">doc</a>).
I was supervised by <a href="">Aurore Guillevic</a> and <a href="https://members.loria.fr/EThome/">Emmanuel Thomé</a>.
I work mainly with public-key cryptography based on elliptic curves:
classic elliptic curve cryptography, pairing-based cryptography, and isogeny-based post-quantum cryptography.<br>

Projects I have been working on:
<ul>
    <li>
        Chains of elliptic curves for ZK proofs:
        <a href="https://ia.cr/2021/1152">Bandersnatch</a> with <a href="https://x.com/asanso">Antonio Sanso</a> and <a href="">Zhenfei Zhang</a>,
        a <a href="https://ia.cr/2024/1737">work</a> on generalizing it with <a href="">Aurore Guillevic</a> (2024).
    </li>
    <li>
        Verifiable delay functions based on isogenies and pairings:
        the <a href="https://ia.cr/2019/166">paper</a> written with <a href="https://x.com/asanso">Antonio Sanso</a> and <a href="https://defeo.lu">Luca De Feo</a>,
        and the open-source <a href="https://github.com/isogenies-vdf/isogenies-vdf-sage">implementation</a> (2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        Pairing-friendly curves with embedding degree between five and eight:
        the <a href="https://ia.cr/2019/431">paper</a> with <a href="">Aurore Guillevic</a> and <a href="https://members.loria.fr/EThome/">Emmanuel Thomé</a> (2019).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Acoustics</h2>
In parallel with cryptography, I got a master in acoustics in 2024.
I graduated from the master <a href="">WAVES</a>, an Erasmus Mundus master program between
Universidade de Coimbra,
Universitat Politècnica de València,
Aix-Marseille Université, and École Centrale Méditerrannée.
During these two years, I enjoyed implementing wave equation in Matlab. In particular, I worked on simulating clarinet sounds from the mechanical system of the mouth piece.
I wrote my <a href="">master thesis</a> about characterizing the seabed sediment using a broadband frequency echosounder.
I was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=78X32dMAAAAJ&hl=en">Noela Sanchez</a>, <a href="https://www.uned.es/universidad/docentes/en/ciencias/daniel-rodriguez-perez.html">Daniel Pérez</a> and <a href="https://www.upv.es/ficha-personal/VESPINOS">Víctor Espinosa</a> (2024).

<h2>More</h2>

I have been working on several interdisciplinary projects in my free time.
